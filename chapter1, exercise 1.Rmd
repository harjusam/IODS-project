*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.*
"This course seems to be very different compared to more practical hands-on -courses during my former studies at medical school.I heard about this course from my supervisors and I also received an email concerning this course. I hope to learn to take advantage of R in my research work."
